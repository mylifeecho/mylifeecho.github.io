My name is Alexey Rodiontsev. I’m a software engineer at Irdeto, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I graduated from Quantum Electronics chair of Novosibirsk State University with Master’s degree in Physics. During my studies I was into programming and eventually decided to convert my hobby into my profession. After a small experience in freelance job I found a position of .NET software developer and have been working with Microsoft technology stack since 2010. When I have some free time I like to learn new programming languages and technologies, try different productivity tools and develop myself with the help of online courses (I like the idea of continuous education). Also I’m interested in IT, weightlifting and motorcycles.
